2.0,W,i took her for research methods and had to drop her class half way nice lady but veryyyyy tough grader and gives you an f even if you do the work i had fs even though i did my work and gave everything on time usually gives assignments and the final research project the lectures are pretty long overall i do not reccomend

1.0,W,you absolutely have to read every night because she has pop quizzes so randomly sometimes once or twice a week and they are very technical questions that multiple choice and she drop it at the end when she drops your lowest quiz grade we also has a paper that she changed to being worth percent of our grade after turning it in
4.5,W,take notes for a grade read assigned chapters hw test are over lecture readings extra credit does not let you fail amazing at help a semester research paper pgs but if you ask her for help visit her office working hard an easy a bc she helps you out so much you will learn if dedicated
4.0,W,professor ledbetter may seem a little all over the place okay she really is all over the place read the textbook a test every couple of weeks a lecture and reading there for help all you have to do is ask she has plenty of material to help you with your topics for her research paper i really enjoyed her class
1.0,W,papers for a short summer term please do yourself a favor and take her class tough grader endless homework
4.5,W,pat ledbetter is extremely knowledgeable and certainly knows this subject inside and out she is very involved with the online students as she would email me right back if ever i had any issues or questions she interacts with the class in the discussion forums as well i must tell you however that you do need to do the work she likes to assign writing papers and her tests can be challenging but if you aim to learn and do the work you will learn she is very good at what she does but she is pretty tough
2.5,W,not fully comprehend half of the time what she is saying if you have not taken spanish before or during high school do not take her she did not explain the materials really well her tests are easy if you know spanish tests drops
2.5,W,meh she was alright take her again for an easy a but if you worry about your grades throughout out the semester and want to physically see them on blackboard not the teacher for you because she always takes forever to post grades
5.0,M,his enthusiasm was contagious and i even appreciated his quirks i still display those brass and copper mobiles in my living room judging from the other ratings i was very lucky to get on his good side
4.0,W,she is funny in a sarcastic way lectures are all over the place because she is clearly passionate about her class but the tests are easy with minimal studying and before every exam she does a review
5.0,W,great professor very enthusiastic and cares about her students she is so genuine and nice i hate history so this class was boring for me but very easy her tests are easy if you go to the review she tells you whats going to be on the test the class before the test she give out on her essays but its ok overall great woman
5.0,W,i loved professor she was great her lectures could be a bit boring sometimes but she always tried to keep everyone engaged in class she gives essays and tests and non-cumulative final the tests are easy she gives a review but the essays can be a bit difficult she can be a tough grader on the essays easy to get a b on them
4.0,W,loves history passionate but is an extremely tough grader on her four essays most people attended class only for tests power points posted online but you would have read for extra materialdetails extremely organized
4.5,W,professor is very smart and she knows what talking shes also very passionate about history so her lectures are very detailed her mannerisms are hilarious and i would love to take her class again she grades a little tough on papers but not too bad papers exams including the final which cumulative
4.0,W,is an amazing teacher really gets into her lectures and captures your interest as if she is telling you a story in class four essays need the textbook to have successful papers tests are easy attendance mandatory but go to the review sessions before the test she basically tells you whats going to be on them great class
2.0,W,she grades tough i had another teach re grade papers and the grades where very different
3.0,W,her class was offered to me through apus she was very helpful though there were quite a bit of essays and you truly had to try for your grade we also had to read a novel chosen from her list for the final essay but her grading on the final essay was very lenient
4.5,W,the course itself uses no textbook so she has her own slides she posts the comes directly from these slides she is not a easy marker but a fair marker if you write a b grade answer expect that grade read those slides and expect an b or higher also she adjusts deadlines and grades if need be overall very kind professor
4.5,M,i love kent so yeah work but he is ultra nice and helpful you know exactly what essays you will have on tests so if you prepare those in advance that helps a ton the hardest thing is his tf on exams he loves teaching and always remembers name always study a couple hours every day and you should be good
4.5,M,hardestsmartest professor ever met in my life he was even the co-author of our textbook that many colleges use lol i only earned an a in his class because of his incredible teaching ability he will fill the entire board up multiple times per lecture but you better write every word of it down he never gets off topic and always helps you
4.5,M,dr kent is my favorite teacher he is very thorough and tells you everything you need to know studying is a must for this class especially for the essay questions but he gives study guides that literally has everything on it you will need so helpful always made time if i understand something also gives amazing extra credit
4.0,M,dr class is tough but his willingness to help makes a good grade possible however because he is so passionate about what he teaches he is extremely thorough as long as you mind putting in the hard work kent is a great teacher he truly cares about the success of his students i had him for l and taking him again for
4.5,W,have taken many classes with gel highly recommended if you want to learn how to dance go to her
5.0,M,amazing take him for he knows what he is doing gpa booster
1.5,M,lectures were extremely unclear the first midterm was a disaster no one knew what he was asking tries to be helpful but makes students uncomfortable instead he will interrupt you throughout your entire presentation making it very difficult to keep things flowing the content of the class is good but the instruction of it was very poor
2.0,M,ian is a weird guy and not a great instructor but easy enough to do well if you readmemorize the textbook and show up to class he loves to hear himself speak so hard to have meaningful conversations his marking is inconsistent and ambiguous at times he really lecture so you have to read and memorize the book to do well
2.0,M,he will not look over any rough drafts for papers you may have the electronic journals are the biggest nuisances you will ever get his tests are very random and rely on very small facts from the books you have read do not be late do show up to every class do your electronic journals and you should be fine
1.5,W,course is listed as online but should be shown as hybrid because you have to go to campus for tests have to email her multiple times before receiving a response and by that point it is too late uninterested in helping students in anyway horrible at clarifying what needs to be done if you take her course you will regret it
4.0,M,freaking love this guy i think his f bomb record is a class takes nothing seriously but really really knows his stuff his goals are to make us laugh and help us view the world around us with a healthy dose of criticism humor probably one of my fave people on the planet
2.0,M,he always went over the scheduled end time if you have word for word answers on the exam you would not receive full credit the subject was boring to begin with and he made the class even more boring not very professional only plus he never made you do busy work everything had a purpose
5.0,M,i took him for semesters of hebrew and he was one of the greatest professors i ever had
3.0,M,he likes to go on and on about his whole lifestory do not expect him to stay on topic most of the things you learn in this class will be from the textbook not from him he only took attendance times so a lot of people skipped many of his classes and just did the readings but he assign any papers or homework other than that nice
3.5,M,a very nice and lenient professor he does tend to go off topic during lectures unfortunately we get to finish all the chapts and topics during my fall semester honestly i just think getting old but not a bad professor although he only took attendance sometimes best to show up to know what will be on tests no hw
1.0,M,a junior and a i took him during my first semester at bc his class is still the only class in my life that gotten a c in his exams have nothing to do with the textbook and his lectures are not coherent writing this review because i want to make sure other students make the same mistake i did take him
2.0,M,very unclear long rambling lectures very self-centered man lectures were about himself and about the material test questions had some surprises content that you can be sure was never covered in class he is sadly nearly tenured
1.0,M,prof class was horrible not only did i get nothing out of his class but it was the first class i got a c in always received a b or an a in a psyc class he gets off topic in a heartbeat so you end up lost hes so disorganized some people should not be allowed to teach please do not take him or regret it as i have now
1.0,M,if you have barely any interest in the subject of psychology i fully recommend taking his class for you will pass he took most of the time in class to talk about his personal life barley uses the textbook two tests plus a final drops the lowest grade he was so behind on teaching us that he gave every student a for the second exam
2.0,M,eaaaasy grade just show up didnt need to pay attention half of the time never used the textbook and still passed only tests lowest score is dropped very much a story telling teacher mostly about his personal life and random things going on in class
1.0,M,i am a junior with a and he is the worst teacher i have ever had he skips steps in processes which makes everyone lost is never in his office during his office hours always late to class and receiving text messages and phone calls puts homework on the syllabus and never mentions it and expects it to be done take him
2.5,M,he knows his stuff but not there for his students very distant professor and not very approachable very harsh grader do not take if you are not an english major
1.0,M,if a student who is horrible at taking exams or actually have a life and have to work in order to pay for college do not take any course with professor kurylo his class is exams and attendance no extra credit no project and no presentation he does not care if you fail
5.0,M,i thought he was weird at first but i grew to love his weirdness i love his sarcasm i only pay attention to catch the few sarcastic jokes he throws out good guy teaches clearly he also makes funny faces without noticing super interesting haha
5.0,M,prof kurylo is not the typical college professor that just want you to memorize a bunch of stuff and then feed it back on a paper he really expect you to think on his test it is more benefit for you to understand why rather than just study like a robot
4.0,M,this is my third time taking one of classes and i am still very happy with his teaching and testing techniques the test are fairly difficult but there is always a curve as long as you are a good note taker you will be fine also read the stories and diagrams in the textbook almost always at least one question related to them on exam
3.5,M,delamater is incredibly knowledgeable and has a lot to say this can work against him however because he will often go on and on about something that could have been said in minutes he is also disrespectful--making students feel embarrassed for saying the wrong thing mocking students rolling his eyes
2.5,M,i dont recommend him he know how to explain no extra credit no homework no study guide three exams extremely hard you have to study on your own and read the book a few times to get the concepts well
2.0,M,professor abramov where do i even begin his notes are confusing and his tests are extremely hard he comes into class talks for minutes and then you leave and have to read the textbook front to back the final was chapters he should retire expect to self teach yourself everything he is too difficult for an introduction course
5.0,M,personally i think he is the best professor in brooklyn college simply not enough space to tell you all the good things about him he really makes it easy to do well in a tough class show up to class and take notes make sure you understand the material and you will do not just fine but get an a if you want to understand stats you must take him
4.5,M,he is the best for statistics homework total super eas y if you go to class three exams including the final and you are allow to bring cheats sheets for the three exams also the final is very easy take him if you want to learn statistics
4.5,M,i have other stats classes that i have taken to compare him to and hands down i wish i would have had him first one of the most understanding statistics professors ever had makes the lessons clear to understand offers extra help in any way he can the material is hard but you leave understanding statistics the way he teaches it
