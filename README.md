# n-grams, Autocompletion, and Gender Bias

**A CPEN 221 MiniProject**

Featuring n-gram sorting and auto-completion, we have built a functional search engine.

> See the mini-project description on [Notion](https://cpen221ubc.notion.site/n-grams-Autocompletion-and-Gender-Bias-a1354ae0091d4f5bac9aa6caa8310b51).

## Overview
This project showcases the implementation of several key concepts including n-grams for text analysis, an autocompletion feature for search queries, and an exploration into gender bias within data sets. The project is structured around several key components, each contributing to the overall functionality of the search engine.

## Features
- **N-Grams Analysis:** Breaks down text into n-grams for sophisticated text analysis.
- **Autocompletion:** Implements autocompletion functionality to predict and suggest search terms based on input.
- **Gender Bias Analysis:** Utilizes data sets to explore and analyze gender bias in various contexts.
- **Interactive GUI:** Features a user interface for interacting with the autocompletion feature and displaying results.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to have Java installed on your machine.

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 11 or newer

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NakulGD/Search-Engine.git
```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
```bash
cd Search-Engine
```

3. Compile the project (ensure you have gradle installed or use the provided gradle wrapper):
```bash
./gradlew build
```

4. To run the application, use the following command:
```bash
java -jar build/libs/Search-Engine-0.5-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## Usage
The application can be used to analyze text data for n-grams, perform autocompletion, and analyze gender bias. It features a GUI for autocompletion that can be invoked directly from the command line.
